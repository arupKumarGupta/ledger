# Command: cp env.template .env.local

# AWS Region - Mumbai (or your preferred region)
VITE_AWS_REGION=ap-south-1

# AWS Cognito Identity Pool ID

# 2. Copy this file: cp env.template .env.local
# 3. Replace VITE_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID with your actual pool ID
# 4. Restart dev server: yarn dev
# 5. For GitHub Pages deployment, add these as GitHub Secrets

# Security Note:
# ✅ NO credentials (access keys/secrets) are stored here
# ✅ Cognito provides temporary credentials automatically
# ✅ Safe to deploy to GitHub Pages or any static host

# Storage Mode:
# ⚠️ CLOUD-ONLY: This app uses DynamoDB as the primary storage (no localStorage)
# ⚠️ AWS Cognito MUST be configured for the app to work
# ⚠️ All data operations go directly to DynamoDB for consistency across devices
